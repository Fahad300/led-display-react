- [x] Static files served from `/static/uploads/`
- [x] Backend URL utility (`getBackendUrl()`) configured
- [x] Client-side URL conversion utility (`getFileUrl()`) working

### Security
- [x] JWT authentication implemented
- [x] Password hashing with bcrypt
- [x] CORS configured for cross-origin requests
- [x] File upload validation (type, size)

### Database
- [x] TypeORM migrations in place
- [x] Database connection pooling configured
- [x] File metadata stored in database
- [x] Session management implemented

## üìã Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Configuration

#### Server `.env` file:
```env
# Database
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USERNAME=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_NAME=led_display

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=your_secure_jwt_secret_here

# Server
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=production

# File Upload
UPLOAD_PATH=./uploads
MAX_FILE_SIZE=104857600

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

#### Client `.env` file:
```env
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://your-server-ip:5000
```

### 2. Database Setup

```bash
cd server
npm run db:setup          # Initialize database
npm run migrate           # Run migrations
```

### 3. Build Applications

```bash
# Build client
cd client
npm install
npm run build

# Build server
cd ../server
npm install
npm run build
```

### 4. Start Production Server

```bash
cd server
npm start
```

### 5. Serve Client Build

Option A: Using `serve`:
```bash
npm install -g serve
cd client/build
serve -s . -p 3000
```

Option B: Using nginx (recommended):
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    root /path/to/client/build;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }

    location /api {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }

    location /static {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
    }

    location /socket.io {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }
}
```

## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

### Health Checks
- [ ] Backend server is running on port 5000
- [ ] Frontend is accessible
- [ ] Database connection is established
- [ ] File uploads work correctly
- [ ] Image/Video previews display properly
- [ ] Authentication works (login/logout)
- [ ] Real-time updates via WebSocket
- [ ] Slide transitions work smoothly

### Test User Flow
1. Login with credentials
2. Upload an image file
3. Create a new image slide
4. Verify image preview in admin page
5. Navigate to home page
6. Check if slide appears correctly
7. Navigate to display page (fullscreen)
8. Verify slideshow works

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Minor Issues (Non-Breaking)

### ESLint Warnings
- Some unused variables in components (cosmetic, doesn't affect functionality)
- React Hook dependency warnings (reviewed, safe to ignore)
- Regex escape character warnings in URL patterns (working correctly)

These warnings do not affect production functionality and can be addressed in future updates.

## üîß Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Monitor server logs: `tail -f server/logs/combined.log`
- Check disk space for uploads: `server/uploads/`
- Backup database regularly
- Update dependencies monthly
- Review and clean up old uploaded files

### Performance Monitoring
- Check API response times
- Monitor video preload performance
- Review WebSocket connection stability
- Monitor database query performance

## üöÄ Production Optimizations Applied

1. **File Serving**: Static files served directly via Express static middleware
2. **Video Preloading**: Client-side caching for smooth video playback
3. **API Caching**: Dashboard data cached for 5 minutes to reduce API calls
4. **Socket.IO**: Real-time updates between admin and display pages
5. **Image Optimization**: Proper image loading with error handling
6. **Database Indexing**: Optimized queries with proper indexes
