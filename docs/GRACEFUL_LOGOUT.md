# Graceful Logout Feature

## Overview
When a new user logs in, the system automatically logs out any previously logged-in users. This ensures **single-session enforcement** - only one user can have control at a time.

Instead of abruptly disconnecting users with a JavaScript `alert()`, the system now shows a beautiful, professional modal dialog.

---

## How It Works

### 1. **Backend: Session Invalidation**
Location: `server/src/routes/auth.ts`

When a user successfully logs in:
1. ✅ Find all active sessions for that user
2. ❌ Mark them as `isActive: false`
3. 📡 Broadcast a `force-reload` event via Socket.IO

```typescript
// Invalidate all existing sessions
for (const session of existingSessions) {
    session.isActive = false;
    await sessionRepository.save(session);
}

// Broadcast force-logout to all connected clients
socketManager.broadcastUpdate({
    type: "force-reload",
    domain: "all",
    data: {
        reason: "new_login",
        message: "Another user has logged in. This session has been terminated.",
        userId: user.id,
        username: user.username
    }
});
```

---

### 2. **Frontend: Graceful Modal**
Location: `client/src/components/ForceLogoutModal.tsx`

A beautiful React modal component that:
- 🎨 Shows a professional amber warning header
- 📝 Displays the new user's username
- ✅ Provides two clear action buttons:
  - **Login Again** - Redirects to login page
  - **Cancel** - Redirects to login page

**Key Features:**
- Clean, modern UI design
- Semi-transparent backdrop
- Smooth fade-in animation
- Prevents clicking outside to dismiss
- Fully responsive

```typescript
<ForceLogoutModal 
    isOpen={showLogoutModal}
    newUserUsername="admin@persivia.com"
    onClose={handleCloseModal}
/>
```

---

### 3. **Global Force-Logout Listener**
Location: `client/src/App.tsx`

A global component that:
1. ✅ Listens for `force-reload` Socket.IO events
2. 🚫 **Skips display page** (display should never be interrupted)
3. 🔓 Clears authentication token
4. 🎬 Shows the graceful logout modal

```typescript
const ForceLogoutListener: React.FC = () => {
  const [showLogoutModal, setShowLogoutModal] = useState(false);
  const [newUserUsername, setNewUserUsername] = useState<string>("");

  useEffect(() => {
    // Skip on display page
    if (location.pathname === "/display") return;

    // Listen for force-logout events
    onSocketUpdate((event) => {
      if (event.type === "force-reload" && event.data?.reason === "new_login") {
        localStorage.removeItem("token");
        setNewUserUsername(event.data.username);
        setShowLogoutModal(true);
      }
    });
  }, []);

  return <ForceLogoutModal {...} />;
};
```

---

### 4. **Display Page Protection**
Location: `client/src/components/SlidesDisplay.tsx`

The display page is **NEVER** logged out:
- 📺 Display page is public and non-interactive
- 🔄 It only refreshes data when updates are received
- ⛔ Force-logout events are **completely ignored** on `/display`

```typescript
if (event.data?.reason === "new_login") {
    const isDisplayPage = window.location.pathname === "/display";
    
    if (isDisplayPage) {
        logger.info("📺 Display page - ignoring force-logout, continuing refresh");
        // Continue with data refresh only
    } else {
        // Show graceful logout modal
        setShowLogoutModal(true);
    }
}
```

## User Experience

### Before (Old Behavior) ❌
```
[User 1 is working on HomePage]
[User 2 logs in]
→ ALERT: "Another user has logged in. You have been logged out."
→ [User 1 clicks OK]
→ Redirected to login page
```

**Problems:**
- Abrupt JavaScript alert (poor UX)
- No information about who logged in
- Feels like an error or bug

---

### After (New Behavior) ✅
```
[User 1 is working on HomePage]
[User 2 logs in as admin@persivia.com]
→ Beautiful modal appears:
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ ⚠️  Session Ended                   │
   ├─────────────────────────────────────┤
   │ Another user has logged in to the   │
   │ system.                             │
   │                                     │
   │ 📧 New user: admin@persivia.com     │
   │                                     │
   │ For security reasons, only one user │
   │ can be logged in at a time.         │
   │                                     │
   │ Would you like to log in again?     │
   │                                     │
   │        [Cancel]  [Login Again]      │
   └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Benefits:**
- Professional, polished UI
- Clear explanation of what happened
- Shows who logged in
- User feels in control with clear options

## Technical Details

### Modal Styling
- Uses Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Custom fade-in animation (0.3s ease)
- z-index: 10000 (always on top)
- Backdrop: semi-transparent black overlay
- Color scheme: Amber warning theme

### Animation
```css
@keyframes fade-in {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: scale(0.95);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: scale(1);
  }
}
```

### State Management
```typescript
// Modal state
const [showLogoutModal, setShowLogoutModal] = useState(false);
const [newUserUsername, setNewUserUsername] = useState<string>("");

// Show modal when force-logout event is received
setShowLogoutModal(true);

// Close modal (triggers navigation to login)
setShowLogoutModal(false);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Modal Not Showing?
1. Check browser console for Socket.IO connection errors
2. Verify `force-reload` event is being broadcast
3. Ensure user is not on `/display` page
4. Check that Socket.IO server is running

### Display Page Getting Logged Out?
1. Verify route detection logic in `SlidesDisplay.tsx`
2. Check console logs for "📺 Display page detected"
3. Ensure Socket.IO is properly filtering events

### Modal Shows But Doesn't Redirect?
1. Check `handleCloseModal` function
2. Verify `navigate()` is being called
3. Check browser console for navigation errors
